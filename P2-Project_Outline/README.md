# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
As a parent of two messy children I needed a way to encourage and organize their chores. 
Choreganizer is an app to help parents organize household chores. 
Parents can set-up and assign chore goals with due dates for each child.
Once a chores is complete, the child can visually see a picture of their progress towards the goal 
 and earn badges for doing extra.

The sign-in form will matching data to database with hashing and salting.
* Chore assignment: The user can create chores on Edit template from dropdown menu of member and chore with pop-up calendar to set due date. 
User will be able to click add/edit/delete chores with button in the form to change data in database. 
Confirmation of update by "flash" or "alert" will let user know data updated form.

### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn
For this project I will learn how to implement color-filling of a picture outline. I will research how to use different users access levels on the application.
Creating a signed-in confirmation,salting, and hashing was something I learned for Python by not in Java, so I will have to learn this for Java.
